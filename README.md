### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an economist, data scientist, Pythonista, and open-source advocate with a focus on public policy. I live in Washington, D.C.

### Work

- **Co-founder and CEO of [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org)**. PolicyEngine is an nonprofit that provides free, open source software to computes the impact of public policy. Our tax-benefit models span the US, UK, Canada, and Nigeria, and I spend most of my time building this organization. You can see our work at [github.com/PolicyEngine](https://github.com/PolicyEngine) or use our software at [policyengine.org](https://policyengine.org).
- **Founder and president of the [UBI Center](https://github.com/ubicenter)**. The UBI Center is a nonprofit think tank conducting quantitative research into universal basic income policies. The UBI Center originally incubated PolicyEngine, and now it primarily applies PolicyEngine software for its research.
